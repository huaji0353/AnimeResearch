a list of anime datasets
Including kaggle, cloud disk , url database, crawlable site 
% I have a feeling that it will become increasingly difficult to collect anime datasets in the future

more source we need , I recently investigated deeply on these anime booru site
booru mainly distributed on anime draw, character "photo" , fanart etc .. and it is a large-scale, Even with some  different sources these set will be extremely small distributions in booru .
It's very very limited usage, generalization bad, coverage poor
more data source is generative model need, although I haven't seen any study on GAN with Extra Training Data

**Please respect the these dataset usage, Do not use commercially, Research only**
